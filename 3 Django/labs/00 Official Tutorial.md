# Lab 0: Django Tutorial

Get started with Django by stepping through the ["Writing your first Django app" tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) from the Django documentation. You should get through at least the first three tutorial sections, but keep going if you have time.

Before you start the tutorial, make a `django` directory in your code folder.

Try your best to go slowly, and take care to read each note in the tutorial. If something unexpected happens, or you get confused or stuck, ask for help rather than spinning your wheels. However, don't worry too much about understanding how each piece works, as there are many components that must work together to make a working app. We'll look at the big picture and how the moving parts fit together during lecture.
