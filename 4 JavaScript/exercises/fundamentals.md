# Exercise: Fundamentals

## Exercise 1: Personal Greetings

Can you write a javascript program that:

1. Prompts the user for their name and stores it in a variable.
2. Then prompts the user for their age and stores it in a variable.
3. Finally, uses an alert to print out a greeting to the user that tells them their name and age.

Example: "Hello John, you are 25 years old!"

## Exercise 2: Simple Calculator

Can you write a javascript program that:

1. Prompts the user for a two numbers and stores them in separate variable.
2. Calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of the two numbers.

Example: If the user enters 5 and 2, the program should display:

```
"5 + 2 = 7"
"5 - 2 = 3"
"5 * 2 = 10"
"5 / 2 = 2.5"
"5 % 2 = 1"
```

## Exercise 3: Temperature Converter

Can you write a javascript program that:

1. Prompts the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit and stores it in a variable.
2. Converts the temperature to Celsius and stores it in another variable.
3. Displays the temperature in Celsius to the user.

Example: If the user enters 32, the program should display:

```
"32 degrees Fahrenheit is 0 degrees Celsius"
```

## Exercise 4: Number Guessing Game

Can you write a javascript program that:

1. Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and stores it in a variable. (Hint: use `Math.floor(1 + Math.random() * 100)` to generate a random number between 1 and 100)
2. Prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 and stores it in a variable.
3. Displays a message to the user indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
